# SPFC Algorithmic Botany
#### ðŸŒ¿ This course on Algorithmic Botany examines what role computation plays in shaping the present and future of this simple, very old, and very human endeavor of capturing the beauty of the natural world in our art. In some ways, by using code to express our artistic observations on plant life, weâ€™ll be able to distill the qualities of plant-ness with a clarity unique to this medium.

"Perhaps plants are some of earthâ€™s oldest computers."

## Objective:
- Examine the contradictions that come with using code (depict plants with code)
- Optimize and otherwise manipulate nature
- Through code and theory, is to make art that operates like nature, within nature, and for the benefit of nature

## Course Study: 
- Week 1: Orientation â€“ Introductions, community agreement, learning objectives, technical setup. Weâ€™ll also do a warmup exercise in using randomness in plant-themed generative art.
- Week 2: Trees â€“ Implement the L-System method for drawing trees and discuss the ways in which trees have influenced human thought over history.
- Week 3: Small ecologies â€“ Dive into Cellular Automata and consider what the software equivalent of home gardening might look like.
- Week 4: Biomimicry â€“ Survey several schools of thought of what it means to design with, like, and for nature.
- Week 5: Review â€“ Wrap up the session by reflecting on how we have learned and can continue to fuse plant thinking with the way we engage with and make software.
